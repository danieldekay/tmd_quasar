# TMD Nuxt Frontend

- This project is a frontend for a headless wordpress site.
- Follow best practices for NUXT and frontend projects.
- We use pnpm package manager
- We use vuetify and materio

# What is TMD?
- tangomarathons.com
- a wordpress page with my custom tmd_core plugin, that uses metabox.io for custom post types and fields.

## General Rules

- DESIGN.md contains the overall project design, and may be updated based on user feedback.
- The long-term plan is in PLAN.md, and the short term plan in TODO.md
  - Keep them updated based on user feedback. Act as a good product owner and be very helpful for the user to tell you what he wants. The user's name is Daniel.
- Do only one thing at a time.
- Use *git-flow*, start and close new features, and regularly check code in after the user approves.

## Quasar / Vue
- when you create new pages, also add them to nav and add routes
