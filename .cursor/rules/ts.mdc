# Code Quality

- Run `pnpm lint`to check for errors
- Always check for and handle undefined values when dealing with optional properties (property?: type). Use null coalescing operators (||, ??) or explicit checks to provide default values before assignment to non-nullable types.


# Rules

- Always check for and handle undefined values when dealing with optional properties (property?: type). Use null coalescing operators (||, ??) or explicit checks to provide default values before assignment to non-nullable types.
- We have a very strict typsecript setting, and should be very careful in type annotation
